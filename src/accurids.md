# ACCURIDS Demonstrator

The demonstrator makes use of the ACCURIDS FAIR data registry. 

We demonstrate data exchange between industry and an organization. 

For example, exchange of information related to clinical studies between a hospital and a pharmaceutical company.

The diagram below represents the use case of the demonstrator with two ACCURIDS instances, both acting as consumers and providers of information.
