# FAIR Dataspaces

FAIR Dataspaces is a BMBF-funded project that aims to bridge the gap between research and industry-related data infrastructures. This is primarily done by combining data infrastructures from the German research data infrastructure ([NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/)) with industry driven standards established by [Gaia-X](https://gaia-x.eu/).

## Getting started

FAIR-DS uses a few core building blocks to enable data exchange.

1. Federated catalog to register all available connectors and assets this is done via the W3C recommended [DCAT Catalog](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/) vocabulary.
2. Negotiation of data exchange is done via the Dataspace Protocol, a formal description of the protocol can be found [here](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/dataspace-protocol).


### Demonstrators

Demonstrators have been developed to show the possible interactions between different data infrastructures. These include: 

- [Geoengine](./geoengine.md): 
- [accurids](./accurids.md):
- [expandAI](./expandAI.md):
- [ruqad](./ruqad.md):

## FAQ

### What is a dataspace ?

A data space is a distributed data system based on common guidelines and rules. The users of such a data space can access the data in a secure, transparent, trustworthy, simple and standardized manner. Data owners have control over who has access to their data and for what purpose and under what conditions it can be used. These data spaces enable digital sovereignty, as the data remains in the possession of the company or research institute until it is retrieved.
