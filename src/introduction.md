# FAIR Dataspaces

FAIR Dataspaces is a BMBF funded project that tries to bridge the gap between research and industry related data infrastructures.

A data space is a distributed data system based on common guidelines and rules. The users of such a data space can access the data in a secure, transparent, trustworthy, simple and standardized manner. Data owners have control over who has access to their data and for what purpose and under what conditions it can be used. These data spaces enable digital sovereignty, as the data remains in the possession of the company or research institute until it is retrieved.
